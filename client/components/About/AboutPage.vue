    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a story together is one of the best ways to bring people closer. <b>BeLender</b> is a item borrowing/lending app centered around co-creating and documenting the items’ adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you borrow an item, part of the deal is that you’ll post updates in the item’s diary. You can get imaginative, giving the item a name or backstory, writing from the item’s point of view, or sharing what you accomplished with the item — essentially, act like you’re doing a takeover of the item’s social media page.

      In communities with many renters and other transient populations, people are often itching to get to know their neighbors, but have no way around the awkwardness and activation energy of reaching out to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We imagine that typical items borrowed and lent would be household goods (e.g. KitchenAid mixer, drill), where an individual doesn’t feel justified in purchasing it just for one-time or occasional use, but there’s a good chance that someone out there on BeLender owns it and is willing to let a neighbor borrow it.
